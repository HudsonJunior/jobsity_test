All the mandatorys feature was done.

## Some considerations
- I tried to follow some clean architecture patterns, such as using the data, domain and view layers.
- I tried to write all the code following clean code best practices.
- I used Slivers and other performance tools to create an efficient app.
- I used BLoC as my State Management Library.
- I used DIO as my service provider.
- I used get_it as a service_locator to inject dependencies.

## Things I could do (But did not have time to)
- Created unit tests.
- Improved some UI.
- Used some animations to make the UI look better.
- Paginations on the list TV shows page
